Main tumhe ek ordered list bana kar deta hoon jisme:

* **Basic â†’ Intermediate â†’ Advance** flow hoga
* Har question ke sath **query ka example** hoga
* Saare SQL ke important concepts (DDL, DML, Joins, Subqueries, CTE, Window Functions, Triggers, Stored Procedures, Transactions, Indexing, Performance) cover karenge

Bhai, chaho to main isko **MCQ + Practice Assignment** format me bhi bana sakta hoon jahan tum answer do aur main check karun (logic building ke liye).

ðŸ‘‰ Tum chahte ho main **20 aur alag practice questions (without answer)** banaun taake tum solve karo?
